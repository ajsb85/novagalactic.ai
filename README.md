# Nova Galactic AI 

AMB82's UI/UX experiment displays bounding boxes based on Starfield + Copilot + Space Battle.

The name of this project (Nova Galactic) comes from a corporation in Starfield. They manufacture Ship modules. 

* Only shows the object's bounding boxes near the "target" at the centre of the screen.
* Lock target (the user enables the bonding boxes even if it is outside of the centre)
* Extra UI components in the screen that change with value from the user or current status.
